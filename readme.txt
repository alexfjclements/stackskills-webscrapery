## This project contains two web scrapers created while following Joseph Delgadillo's
## Stack Skills course "The Complete Python Course: Beginner to Advanced". When
## run, each will prompt the user for an input search term. The main file will then
## provide a list of websites and their addresses, while the image file will 
## create a directory with the search term as the name. It will then download
## the first page of image results for the search term using Bing. When this is
## complete it will request a further search term.
